The Lorenz system is a set of three coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations, first introduced by Edward Lorenz in 1963. 
The system describes a simplified model of convection in the Earth's atmosphere and has since become a fundamental example of chaos theory and dynamical systems. 
The equations are as follows:

dx/dt = σ(y - x)
dy/dt = x(ρ - z) - y
dz/dt = xy - βz

where x, y, and z are the state variables, and σ, ρ, and β are parameters.
σ: This parameter represents the Prandtl number, which is a dimensionless number that characterizes the ratio of momentum diffusivity to thermal diffusivity in a fluid.
ρ: This parameter represents the Rayleigh number, which is another dimensionless number that characterizes the ratio of buoyancy to viscous forces in a fluid.
β: This parameter represents the aspect ratio of the system and controls the feedback between the z variable and the other two variables.

One of the most interesting features of the Lorenz system is its ability to exhibit chaotic behavior for certain parameter values.
Chaotic systems are a class of dynamic systems that exhibit sensitive dependence on initial conditions, meaning that small differences in initial conditions can lead to vastly different outcomes over time. 
This phenomenon is often referred to as the "butterfly effect," as it suggests that a butterfly flapping its wings in one part of the world could potentially cause a hurricane in another part of the world. 
Similarly in the case of Lorenz system Increasing σ generally leads to a more chaotic system,Increasing ρ beyond a critical value of approximately 24.74 leads to the onset of chaos in the system
and increasing β generally leads to a more stable and less chaotic system.

The Lorenz system has been extensively studied in a variety of fields, including mathematics, physics, and engineering. 
In his original 1963 paper, "Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow," Lorenz introduced the system and explored its behavior for different parameter values. 
Since then, the system has been the subject of numerous research papers, investigating its properties, behavior, and applications.

One of the seminal papers on the Lorenz system is "The Lorenz Equations: A Reappraisal" by James A. Yorke and Tomás Sauer, which was published in 1991. 
This paper provides a comprehensive review of the properties of the Lorenz system, including its chaotic behavior, bifurcations, and attractors. 
Another influential paper is "Chaotic Dynamics of the Lorenz Equations: A Comparative Study" by B. V. Rathish Kumar and M. S. Vidhya, which compares the behavior of the Lorenz system to other chaotic systems and investigates the effects of changing the parameter values.

The Lorenz system has been studied in numerous applications, including weather prediction, control theory, and cryptography. 
For example, in the paper "Control of Chaos in the Lorenz System by Feedback" by L. M. Pecora and T. L. Carroll, the authors investigate methods for controlling the chaotic behavior of the Lorenz system using feedback control. 
In "Cryptanalysis of Lorenz-like Stream Ciphers" by Martin Hell, the Lorenz system is used as the basis for a cryptographic stream cipher.
